# Restaurant Page

A project to learn the basics of webpack.  Code was written in separate modules and imported to index.js which handles the logic to render new content whenever a nav element is clicked.  This was mainly an exercise to learn about webpack and use ES6 modules, so the restaurant's page design is pretty bare bones and the page layout isn't responsive to mobile phones.
